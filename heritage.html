            <h2>GOLDEN TEMPLE</h2>
            <p>
The Golden Temple is in fact a small part of a much bigger gurdwara complex, known as the Harmandir Sahib. Guru Ram Das acquired the land for the gurdwara in the 16th century. His successor, Guru Arjan began construction, building it lower than the rest of the city in a gesture of humility. The compound was also designed to open on all signs to mirror the fact that it is open to all. After the siteâ€™s inauguration in 1589, the pool was filled with water. The completion of the Golden Temple was a major milestone for Sikhism as it provided a central rallying point for the Sikh community, as well as an important pilgrimage destination.

Guru Arjan was arrested by the Mughal Emperor Jahangir shortly after this, and after refusing to convert to Islam, was tortured and executed in 1606. The Golden Temple fell into the hands of the enemy until the 18th century, when it was liberated by Guru Gobind Singh.

            <h2>Heritage Facts of Jallianwala bagh</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Fact 1:On April 13, 1919, 99 years before today, British officer General Dyer had indiscriminately fired bullets at the unarmed crowd present at Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar. More than 1,000 people were killed in this murder, while more than 1,500 were injured. On the day this cruel incident occurred, it was Baisakhi. After this assassination, the end of British rule began. It is a place in Indian history whose people are disheartened by hearing the historical story. That massacre was condemned worldwide. But after this massacre, the revolutionaries of India had become stronger instead of being reduced. After all, what happened in 1919, due to which innocent people present in Jallianwala Bagh, were killed, who was the main accused in the murder and what punishment did he get?  </li>
